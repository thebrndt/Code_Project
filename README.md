# Code_Project

This is a project I worked on for the CODE University application challenge. I am doing this project in response to the fact that a lot of Namibian citizens are unaware of different government services available. There is no digital directory and the numbers are quite long, so as a result a lot of services aren't made use unless people physically look them up in a telephone directory. I had to manually get the numbers from a telephone directory and compile a list of what I believe to be the most important services at the moment.


## Implemented Features

-Onboarding screen with basic details about the app.
-Opens default dialer app on user's phone with the number of the chosen service already inputed and ready for the user to call.
-The app does not require any permissions or other services such as the internet. It is secure and offline, therefor, accessible to many.
