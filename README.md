# Code_Project

This is a project I am working on for the CODE University application challenge. I am doing this project in response to a recent wave of unreported crime in my country and hopefuly this will reduce some of the friction required for people to actually report crimes.

## Planned Features

I aim for users of the app to be able to dial a number from a list of built-in emergency numbers.
The app should not require any internet to function at all since connectivity is a significant problem for many.

## Currently Implemented Features

-Onboarding screen with basic details about the app.

## Resources Used

-unDraw.co (images)
-YouTube.com (lots of tutorials)
