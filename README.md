# Code_Project

This is a project I am working on for the CODE University application challenge. I am doing this project in response to the fact that a lot of Namibian citizens are unaware of different government services available. There is no digital directory and the numbers are quite long, so as a result a lot of services aren't made use unless people physically look them up in a telephone directory. Which is what I had to do, so others won't have to.

## Planned Features

I aim for users of the app to be able to dial a number from a list of built-in emergency numbers.
The app should not require any internet to function at all since connectivity is a significant problem for many.

## Currently Implemented Features

-Onboarding screen with basic details about the app.

## Resources Used

-unDraw.co (images)
-YouTube.com (lots of tutorials)
